Here are some ways to contribute to the MOEA Framework.  We ask that all
contributions are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and
are complete with any necessary documentation, tests and data files.

These tasks are organized by their level of difficulty.  Easy tasks provide an
excellent starting point for beginners and should require only a few hours of 
development effort.  More difficult tasks may take days or weeks of development
effort, and may require interaction with other contributors to plan and discuss
any changes.

------
 Easy
------

  - Add MOEA/D provider for JMetal (and any other overloaded algorithms) and
    add support for the -JMetal extension to the algorithm name.

  - Add constructors for epsilon arrays to EpsilonBoxDominanceArchive and any
    other classes that use epsilons.  Should these be varadic arrays?

  - ResultFileWriter and MetricFileWriter are technically appenders.  Add
    ResultFileAppender and MetricFileAppender for the case when we want to
    recover and append to the file, and have ResultFileWriter and
    MetricFileWriter start the file from the beginning.  This change will be
    implemented in version 2.0.  This should also allow ResultFileWriter to not
    need the Problem argument, making saving datasets easier.  The
    ResultFileAppender would still need the Problem in order to validate the
    saved entries.

  - ExtractData is overriding the -h,--help option.  This will be fixed in 
    version 2.0.

  - The UF* and CF* methods in CEC2009 are passed both a double array (x) and
    the length of this array (nx) as arguments.  Remove the nx argument and use
    x.length instead.

  - An issue is cropping up when an approximation set is empty (no feasible
    solutions).  The distance metrics result in a value of infinity.  This in
    itself is fine, but becomes problematic when averaging the values with
    SimpleStatistics as a single infinity value skews the results.  Add
    configuration options in global.properties that controls the min/max limits
    for the objectives.

  - Need to determine for which classes does value-based equals methods make
    sense, and provide equals and hashCode implementations for these classes.
    As an example, it doesn't make sense for Solution to provide an equals
    method since there are many possible interpretations of equality.  Are two
    solutions equal if they share the same objective values regardless of their
    decision variables?  Consequently, equals methods don't make sense for
    Populations.  However, a helper class that provides various methods of
    comparison between solutions and populations would be useful.  For
    consistency, use the Apache Commons Lang builder classes to implement
    equals and hashCode.

  - The recently-added misc problems from Van Veldhuizen's dissertation need
    reference set files.  Until reference sets are added, they can't be used
    in the MOEA diagnostic tool.
    
  - Upgrade to Apache Commons Math 3.0
    
  - Upgrade to Apache Commons Codec 1.6
  
  - Upgrade to JFreeChart 1.0.14, JCommon 1.0.17

  - Upgrade to JMetal 4.0.  Some work is required since some packages changed
    between version 3.1 and 4.0.  This change will likely have to wait until a
    major revision as backwards compatibility will likely break.

  - Phase out resumable interface and make all algorithms provide the methods in
    Resumable.  Then, an algorithm which does not support resuming would throw
    an exception, such as NotResumableException, similar to 
    NotSerializableException.  This will also enable checkpoint support for
    nested/wrapped algorithms.
  
  - Add reporting function to Executor which periodically outputs progress
    reports.  It would probably be a good design to provide functionality
    similar to SwingWorker's progress notifications.

  - Add unit tests for the examples.  These tests should simulate the
    instructions provided on the website.

  - To provide consistent output, use of YAML is preferred.  YAML is preferred
    over formats like XML and JSON due to its very simple and human-readable
    syntax.  Find and upgrade output code which is not yet in a YAML format.

  - Get rid of EpsilonHelper, as it only helps on several of the built-in
    problems.  The epsilons should be provided via the epsilon property.  If
    not, throw an exception.

  - When restarting a file, ResultFileWriter and MetricFileWriter first move
    the unclean file to a temporary location and copy the clean contents to the
    original location.  If this process is interrupted for any reason, the
    original file is no longer at its original location, and thus data may be
    lost.  A better approach is to create a temporary file, copy the clean
    contents to the temporary file, then move the temporary file to the original
    location.  This way, if the process is interrupted, the original file
    remains unchanged.  An alternative approach is to detect that the
    temporary file exists and exit with an exception, requiring the user to
    intervene.
    
  - Develop an interface for defining stopping conditions.  Executor should
    provide the necessary functionality for defining stopping conditions.
    
  - PISA selections require a parameter file.  Determine if any of the PISA
    selectors have useful parameters and, if so, add support for writing
    custom parameter files.
    
  - While by default PISA does not support constraints, its specification does
    claim additional data such as constraints can be supported.  Determine if
    any PISA selectors support constraints.  If so, identify how the selector
    represents constraints in the data files.
    
  - Scan the source code for errors, exceptions and warnings which are not
    documented in the HELP file.
    
  - Identify public facing API methods and functions which are not protected
    against invalid inputs, such as null or out-of-bounds values.  Ideally,
    an invalid input which would cause an error should be detected as soon as
    possible in order to provide meaningful feedback to developers (i.e.,
    identify and report a null pointer ASAP rather than wait until dereferenced
    by internal code.
    
  - Add support for integer encodings.  The preferred method would involve
    extending the RealVariable class and simply rounding/truncating the values.
    However, this would need to ensure that no bias is introduced.  For
    instance, all integer values in the range must be representable with
    equal probability.

  - The MOEA Framework can currently connect with C/C++ programs by sending
    data over standard I/O or sockets.  This, however, is not efficient as the
    data must be serialized, transmitted, and parsed between Java and C.  Java
    does have the Java Native Interface (JNI) or similar tools like Java Native
    Access (JNA) for directly invoking methods in natively-compiled libraries.
    Explore ways to develop a faster interface using JNI.
    
  - Develop a MATLAB interface, ideally using the same socket communication
    scheme employed by ExternalProblem.

  - The org.moeaframework.core.fitness package contains code for supporting
    indicator-based methods, but is currently unused.  These should be used to
    implement native indicator-based MOEAs.
    
  - Add the R* indicators.  Open source implementations are available in PISA,
    but will need to be converted to Java.
    
  - The MOEA Framework is primarily a single-threaded library, and currently
    only supports multithreaded evaluation of problems.  This limitation is
    caused by: 1) shared instances which are not thread safe, such as PRNG;
    and 2) the current requirement for reproducibility, which is affected if 
    PRNG is accessed by multiple concurrent threads.  Identify any other 
    limiting factors that would hinder modifying the code to support 
    multi-threaded execution.  Write a report detailing the necessary changes,
    but do NOT implement any changes.
    
  - The MOEA Framework is currently standardized for minimization problems,
    requiring any maximized objectives to be converted to minimization
    objectives (i.e., through negation).  This has several advantages, such as
    standardizing the file representation.  While a more flexible approach
    would allow the problem to define both minimization and maximization
    objectives, this may impact codes which only work on minimized objectives.
    Write a report detailing the necessary changes, but do NOT implement any
    changes.

  - While basic support for grammatical evolution is provided, several other
    Java-based evolutionary computing frameworks provide significantly better
    support for genetic programming and grammatical evolution.  One such
    example is ECJ <http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/>.  Develop
    comprehensive support for genetic programming and grammatical evolution in
    the MOEA Framework (possibly reusing an existing library with a compatible
    license).

  - Develop a GUI that simplifies the use of the framework, allowing users to
    quickly design, run and view the results of experiments.  This should
    support high-dimensional (3D) visualization of Pareto sets, detailed
    runtime and end-of-run performance analysis, a code editor for defining new
    problems in one of the supported scripting languages, etc.
    
  - Internationalization and localization.  This involves translating and
    providing the necessary conversions to allow users of any nationality and
    language to use these tools.
    
  - Product branding.  As the adoption of the MOEA Framework grows, it is
    critical to establish its identity in the open-source market.  A clean,
    modern website design, logo and other materials are necessary to establish
    a web presence and product brand.
