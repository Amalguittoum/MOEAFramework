  We welcome all individuals who wish to help develop or provide support for
  the MOEA Framework.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  In order to maintain a quality product, it is necessary to mandate certain
  requirements on source code contributions (including associated data files and
  other resources).
</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      All contributions must adhere to and be licensed under the 
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public
      License</a> (GNU LGPL), version 3 or later.  The contributor must also ensure 
      that any individual, school or business which may own the rights
      to any part of the contribution agrees to license under the GNU LGPL.
    </li>
    <li>
      All contributions must be fully documented.  As the MOEA Framework is
      academic in nature, the documentation should include citations to the
      original works describing the contribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      The contribution must have academic value.  This means that preference is
      given to works which are published in scientific, peer-reviewed 
      literature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whenever possible, the contribution should be fully tested using 
      <a href="http://www.junit.org/">unit tests</a>.  Tests should cover
      all non-trivial code whose correctness is not immediately obvious.
    </li>
    <li>
      The implementation should follow software best practices, favor clear
      and understandable source code, and follow the general formatting and
      structure of existing code.
    </li>
  </ul>
