<h3>Contribute</h3>
  
<p>
  Contributions from the community are the backbone of open source projects.
  We welcome all individuals who wish to help develop or provide support for
  the MOEA Framework.

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>
  In order to maintain a quality product, it is necessary to mandate certain
  requirements on source code contributions (including associated data files and
  other resources).
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      All contributions must adhere to and be licensed under the 
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public
      License</a> (GNU LGPL), version 3 or later.  The contributor must also ensure 
      that any individual, school or business which may own the rights
      to any part of the contribution agrees to license under the GNU LGPL.
    </li>
    <li>
      All contributions must be fully documented.  As the MOEA Framework is
      academic in nature, the documentation should include citations to the
      original works describing the contribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      The contribution must have academic value.  This means that preference is
      given to works which are published in scientific, peer-reviewed 
      literature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whenever possible, the contribution should be fully tested using 
      <a href="http://www.junit.org/">unit tests</a>.  Tests should cover
      all non-trivial code whose correctness is not immediately obvious.
    </li>
    <li>
      The implementation should follow software best practices, favor clear
      and understandable source code, and follow the general formatting and
      structure of existing code.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4>Submission Process</h4>

<p>
  A submission process is in place to ensure all requirements are satisfied.  
  The submission process begins when the contributor submits a patch file to
  <a href="mailto:admin@moeaframework.org">admin@moeaframework.org</a>.  In
  addition, the contributor should declare all copyright holders and any 
  patents covering the contribution.
</p>

<p>
  One of the core project developers will be assigned to handle the submission.
  The developer will verify that the requirements are satisfied, or notify the
  contributor of what changes are required.  Minor changes will likely be
  fixed internally.  If there are copyright and patent concerns, the developer
  may ask the contributor to obtain and submit a signed document by the
  individuals, school or business who own the rights to the contribution.  This
  is a necessary step to ensure the contribution is legally conveyed
  under the terms of the GNU LGPL.
</p>

<p>
  Upon acceptance, the contribution will be merged into the MOEA Framework or
  one of its extensions.  We ask that contributors be available in the case that
  additional support is needed during this process.
</p>

<h4>Where to Start</h4>

<p>
  The TODO document distributed with the source code is an excellent starting
  point for individuals looking for ways to contribute.  Also check the bug
  tracker and feature request links on the <a href="support.html">support</a>
  page.
