The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and
experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other
general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework
supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm
optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of
algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, ε-MOEA,
GDE3 and MOEA/D. In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary
to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization
algorithms.

Its key features includes:
  * Fast, reliable implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms
  * Extensible with custom algorithms, problems and operators
  * Supports master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization
  * Modular design for constructing new algorithms from existing components
  * Permissive open source license
  * Fully documented source code
  * Over 1200 test cases to ensure validity

Since its initial release in 2011, the MOEA Framework has been downloaded over
27,000 times, averaging about 920 downloads per month this past year.  Please
