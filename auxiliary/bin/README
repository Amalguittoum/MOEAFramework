The MOEA Framework now includes a convenient command line interface that avoids
the need to run verbose Java commands.  This document details the steps to
setup your computer to recognize this new interface.

---------------
 Windows Setup
---------------
  1) Extract the MOEAFramework-%VERSION%.tar.gz file to a folder of your
     choice.  For these instructions, we will assume the folder is
     C:/MOEAFramework-%VERSION%/.
     
     a) You may need to download and install 7-zip <http://www.7zip.org/> to
        extract these files.
     
  2) Modify the Windows PATH to include the bin/ folder.
  
     a) Open the dialog to edit environment variables.  Right-click on the
        My Computer icon and select Properties.  Click on Advanced System
        Settings.  Click on Environment Variables.
        
     b) Click New.  For the variable name, enter 'MOEAFRAMEWORK_HOME' without
        quotes.  For the variable value, enter 'C:/MOEAFramework-%VERSION%'
        without quotes.
        
     b) Determine if an existing PATH variable exists.  The PATH variable may
        also be called 'Path'.
        
     c) If the PATH variable exists, select that entry and click Edit.  The
        PATH value contains folders separated by semi-colons.  Add the
        following entry '%MOEAFRAMEWORK_HOME%/bin' without quotes, and add any
        necessary semi-colon (;) immediately before or after to separate this
        entry from others.

     d) If the PATH variable does not exist, click New.  For the variable name,
        enter 'PATH' without quotes.  For the variable value, enter
        '%MOEAFRAMEWORK_HOME%/bin' without quotes.
        
  3) Test this installation.
  
     a) Open a new Command Prompt window.  This can be done by selecting
        Start -> Accessories -> Command Prompt.
        
     b) In the Command Prompt, type 'moea version' without quotes and press
        Enter.  You should see a line of output showing the version number
        %VERSION%.
        
     c) In the Command Prompt, type 'moea help' without quotes.  This will
        print several lines detailing the use of this tool.

 Linux Setup
-------------
  1) Extract the MOEAFramework-%VERSION%.tar.gz file to a folder of your
     choice.  For these instructions, we will assume the folder is
     /usr/share/MOEAFramework-%VERSION%/.  The following command will extract
     the files:
       tar -xzf MOEAFRamework-%VERSION%.tar.gz -C /usr/share/
          
  2) Navigate to the /usr/share/MOEAFramework-%VERSION%/bin folder.
  
  3) Ensure the moea.sh script is executable.  Run the following command:
       chmod +x moea.sh
        
  4) If you have administrative permissions, create a symbolic link to this
     shell script.  Run the following command:
       ln -s moea.sh /usr/bin/moea
     
  5) If you do not have administrative permissions, you can update the PATH
     environment variable to run this script.
     
     a) First, create a symbolic link for this shell script.  Run the following
        command:
          ln -s moea.sh moea
          
     b) Temporarily, you can modify the PATH with the following command:
          PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/MOEAFramework-%VERSION%/bin
        The PATH will be reset whenever you log off or restart your computer,
        so you will need to run this command whenever you need to use this tool.
        
     c) A more permanent option involves modifying the PATH in your default
        shell's configuration file.  This file is usually called .bash_profile
        or .profile and is located in your home directory.  Edit this file and
        add the following line:
          PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/MOEAFramework-%VERSION%/bin
          
  6) Test this installation.
  
     a) In the terminal, type 'moea version' without quotes and press
        Enter.  You should see a line of output showing the version number
        %VERSION%.
        
     b) In the terminal, type 'moea help' without quotes and press Enter.
        This will print several lines detailing the use of this tool.
