 1. Introduction
-----------------
The MOEA Framework is a Java library for developing and experimenting with
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other general-purpose
optimization algorithms and metaheuristics.  The MOEA Framework comes with 
built-in support for many state-of-the-art algorithms, including the Borg MOEA,
GDE3, NSGA-II, Epsilon-NSGA-II, Epsilon-MOEA and MOEA/D.  Additional algorithms
can be constructed by extending or composing existing components, or imported
from third-party libraries like JMetal <http://jmetal.sourceforge.net/> and 
PISA <http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/pisa/>.

The MOEA Framework is academic in nature, and every effort is taken to maintain
the quality, validity and openness of this project.  To support its academic
role, the MOEA Framework comes equipped with a number of tools to statistically
test and analyze MOEAs.

------------------------------
 3. Installation Instructions
------------------------------
The MOEA Framework is available in source code and binary distributions.  Java
5.0 or later is required to be accessible on the host system.  For source code
distributions, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to compile the code.
For binary distributions, only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is necessary.
Depending on your platform, the JRE or JDK can be obtained from the following
vendors:

  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/>
    * Windows, Linux and Solaris
    
  JRockit JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/jrockit/>
    * Windows, Linux and Solaris
    * May provide better performance and scalability on Intel 32 and 64-bit
      architectures
      
  OpenJDK <http://openjdk.java.net/>
    * Ubuntu 8.04 (or later), Fedora 9 (or later), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 
      openSUSE 11.1, Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 and OpenSolaris
 
  IBM <http://developer.apple.com/java/>
    * AIX, Linux and z/OS
    
  Apple <http://developer.apple.com/java/>

The MOEA Framework is distributed with all required third-party libraries
located in the lib/ directory.  These libraries must be made accessible to the
JRE in order to compile and run the MOEA Framework and any applications that
import or link to the MOEA Framework.  The following provides two alternative
methods for referencing the libraries:

  * Specify JARs on classpath (Unix/Linux only)
      java -classpath $(echo lib/*.jar | sed 's/ /:/g'):. <command>

  * Specify JARs in extension directories
      java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib <command>

An Ant build script is provided to automatically compile the source code and
package the compiled classes in a JAR file.  Ant binaries can be obtained from
<http://ant.apache.org/>.  As an example, the compiled JAR is produced with
the following command: 

  ant package-binary       (for Unix/Linux)
  ant.bat package-binary   (for Windows)
    
The latest version of the MOEA Framework can be downloaded from
