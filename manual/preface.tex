\chapter*{Preface}

Thank you for your interest in the MOEA Framework.  While we have developed the MOEA Framework for our own academic work, we release the library as a free and open source project in the hopes you find it useful.  The latest source code and binaries can be downloaded from \webpage{http://www.moeaframework.org/}.

Academic uses of this work should include an in-text citation, such as the one shown below.  This not only gives credit to the software, but also aids reproducibility by identifying the version number and providing a link for researchers to obtain the software.
