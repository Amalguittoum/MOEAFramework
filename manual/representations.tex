\chapter{Representing Decision Variables}

In \chptref{chpt:problems} we saw various ways to define new problems using real-valued (floating-point) decision variables.  In addition to floating-point values, the MOEA Framework allows problems to be encoded using integers, bit strings, permutations, programs (expression trees) and grammars.  This section details the use of each of these decision variables and their supported variation operators.
